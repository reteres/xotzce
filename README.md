　　六公公照例一脸笑咪咪，褐色的老年斑格外慈祥。任你一会想要买话梅一会又反口还是子油姜。他不用秤，拿筷子在浸满酱油的透明玻璃瓶里，挟一爪如巴掌大的子油姜，扯一张毛边纸包了。孩子们心下也晓得沾了便宜，过六公公店铺不管有事无事，小嘴亲甜，“六公公”长“六公公”短。生意冷清时，便在店铺里玩游戏。我记得有次我就躲在六公公的长袍下，所有的人忙活了一下午也没找着。孩子多，不免有时撞翻了东西，六公公却总是笑着说没事，还夸这个孩子聪明那个孩子机灵。逢着六公公打烊上铺板就更是热闹，孩子们争着递板子，叽叽喳喳。不小心漏了一人，还不依，一定要重新上过。
　　他们走了，小伙子才走到麦垛下。他要干什么，谁知道呢？
　　几个与她一同进城卖瓜的妇女，也暂时离开卖西瓜的三轮车，帮她找孩子。
I can't imagine if there is no snow in winter across the northlands, how it will be sad.
- the words "the beginning of winter" has been over the past two days, but I feel always wander in late autumn, the leaves from time to time from her eyes, across the rustling breeze through my collar, but not cold, just have a kind of disappointed in the wind.
I have been looking forward to snow, looking forward to the distance of the elves come to my window to hear me tell a season of acacia.
But the snow is like a naughty child, forget to go home.
Did not think of the days and the drizzle began to fall.
After "the beginning of winter", no, is the "light snow" after, I can hear the xi resembles seems the rain is really make me excited and lost and afraid.
I'm afraid, afraid I no longer have snow city from now on.
Have a happy time, I dream, I fell on your shoulders, deep smelling the smell of you.
Wake up, the sunlight bright and beautiful outside the window, but you are not in my side.
In the rainy season, falling is not only for the silky rain line, and the flying is my share of the sincere concern for you.
A trickle of splash in the wet streets, copy is like my silent tears;
Under the shade of willow trees lining the clear of your company, as my spirit in the praise, every cell in the dance.
Kung fu can transform, but it won't transform, I have the cordial miss to you!
